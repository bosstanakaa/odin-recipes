        <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>If you've ever carved into a prime rib at a big holiday meal expecting a juicy,
            perfectly pink interior only to discover a dry, overcooked roast, this recipe is 
            for you. Here are some tips from Chef John to get you started: </p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
            <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>This simple, foolproof "mathematical method" for making the very best prime rib will 
                greatly increase your chances of success. Here is the formula: <strong>Multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.</strong> 
                For me it was 5.35 x 5 = 26.75 minutes, which we round up to 27.</li>
            <li>You'll cook your room-temperature prime rib at 500 degrees F for exactly that many minutes. (Twenty-seven minutes, 
                in my case.) Then turn off the oven and <strong>wait 2 hours without opening the door</strong>. When the time's up, remove the prime 
                rib and slice into the most perfectly medium-rare meat you've ever seen. See? That's all it takes to make foolproof 
                prime rib cooked to a perfect pink that's somewhere just a shade under medium rare. </li>
            <li><strong>Just make sure you're starting with a prime rib that has been brought to room temperature!</strong> 
                This is critical in order for the math to work!</li>
            <li>Serve your prime rib with <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/221957/beef-au-jus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef John's Beef Au Jus.</a></li>
