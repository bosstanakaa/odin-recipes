        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>This chilaquiles recipe is an easy Mexican dish my mom taught me. 
            It's a casserole of tortilla chips mixed with eggs and salsa, 
            then topped with cheese. Serve with refried beans.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of oil for frying</li>
            <li>30 (6 inch) corn tortillas, torn into strips</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped onions</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
            <li>1 (7.75 ounce) can Mexican-style hot tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of waterr</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large, heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Fry tortillas and onion in hot oil until crisp and golden brown, stirring frequently. 
                Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Drain the skillet, leaving only a thin residue of oil.</li>
            <li>Place the skillet over medium heat. Return fried tortillas and onion to the skillet and stir in beaten eggs; 
                season with salt. Cook and stir until eggs are firm.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce and water. Reduce heat and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. 
                Sprinkle with cheese and continue cooking until cheese is melted.</li>
        </ol>
